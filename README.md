# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository demonstrates a complete, production-grade machine learning workflow — from raw data to deployed model. The goal is not to chase unrealistic accuracy, but to build a pipeline that can survive in real-world environments.

## 1. Problem Statement
Clearly define the business problem being solved. Machine learning is used only because rule-based logic is insufficient, unstable, or impossible to maintain.

**Questions to justify ML:**
- What business value does the model produce?
- What decision becomes more accurate, faster, cheaper, or safer due to ML?
- Why can’t simple heuristics solve this problem?

## 2. Objectives
The project aims to deliver:
- Clean, validated, reproducible data processing
- Feature engineering based on logic, not guesswork
- A reliable model that generalizes rather than memorizes
- Automated training and evaluation pipeline
- Scalable deployment through a REST API
- Optional CI/CD and monitoring for real-world maintenance
